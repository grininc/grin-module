Some notes
-

- Grin uses composer to provide their extension to the end customer.
- The extension follows semver principles.
- Once the new implementation of Grin_Affiliate is ready to be installed and tested it will get version 2.0.x.
- If an end-user has the previous version of the extension installed via https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/system/web-setup-wizard.html or manually in app/code, the extension must be removed before new installation.

Q&A
-

1. Issue: I updated the extension, but it seems like the old version is installed despite the fact that in the compose.lock file I see the updated version of the extension.

Possible solution: the extension uses a DB queue, which is run in shadow mode. So it might be that you did not kill the old process after the installation.
Try to execute `ps -aux | grep grin_module_webhook` and kill the process if any.

2. Issue: I am using Magento cloud instance and it seems like the 'webhook_grin_module' is not working.

Possible solution: in this case, according to Magento documentation, you need to make sure that the queue job is added into the /app/etc/env.php file like so:
```
...
    'cron_consumers_runner' => [
        'cron_run' => false,
        'max_messages' => 20000,
        'consumers' => [
            'consumer1',
            'consumer2',
            'grin_module_webhook',
            ...
        ]
    ],
...
```
